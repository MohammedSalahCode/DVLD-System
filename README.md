# DVLD System

> DVLD System is a desktop application for managing driving licenses, applying practical skills in C#, OOP, SQL Server, ADO.NET, and a 3-Tier Architecture design.

## ◈ 1. Project Overview

DVLD is a desktop system built to handle all driving license operations. It helps employees manage the entire process in one place — from registering people and booking test appointments to issuing licenses and keeping a full history for every driver.

## ◈ 2. Project Purpose

This project was built as part of a structured learning roadmap to apply real-world software development concepts, including layered architecture, database-driven workflows, and enterprise-style desktop application design.

## ◈ 5. Technology Stack

- **Framework:** C# / .NET Framework 4.8
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server
- **Architecture:** 3-Tier Architecture (Data, Business, and Presentation Layers)
- **Data Access:** ADO.NET
- **UI:** Windows Forms (WinForms)

## ◈ 6. Technical Highlights
- **Modular Design:** Divided into logical modules (People, Users, Applications, etc.) for easier maintenance.
- **Logic Integration:** Implemented solid validation rules and multi-stage workflows to ensure data integrity across the system.
- **Git Best Practices:** Clean and traceable feature-based commit history.

## ◈ 7. Installation and Setup

1. **Database:** Restore `Database/DVLD-System-Database.bak` via SSMS.
2. **Run:** Open the `.sln` file and press **F5**.

> **Note:** If the connection fails, update `Data Source` in `App.config` to match your SQL Server name (e.g., `.` or `.\SQLEXPRESS`).
